and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

The results for the new DataFrame are explained in more detail below. 
- [retirement_titles](Resources/retirement_titles.png)	
- [mentorship_eligibilty](Resources/mentorship_eligibilty.png)	

- Based of the Retirement Titles table:
  * We can see that a large number of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff will be retiring soon.
  * With the low number of Assistant Engineers we can assume most are under the age of retirement and will be filling up the Egineer Roles
  
- Based of the Mentorship Eligibility table:
  * We can see that out of the top 20 eligibile mentorships 50 % of them are for Senior Role.
  * This reinforces our assumption that assitant engineers are taking entrly level/ engineer roles while entry level/egineers are taking on Senior roles
