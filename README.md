## Overview of the analysis
The purpose  of this analysis is to  determine the number of retiring employees per title,
and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results
The results for the new DataFrame are explained in more detail below. 
- [retirement_titles](Resources/retirement_titles.png)	
- [mentorship_eligibilty](Resources/mentorship_eligibilty.png)	

- Based of the Retirement Titles table:
  * We can see that a large number of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff will be retiring soon.
  * With the low number of Assistant Engineers we can assume most are under the age of retirement and will be filling up the Egineer Roles
  
- Based of the Mentorship Eligibility table:
  * A total of 1550 mentorships are eligible.
  * We can see that out of the top 20 eligibile mentorships 50 % of them are for Senior Role.
  * This reinforces our assumption that assitant engineers are taking entrly level/ engineer roles while entry level/egineers are taking on Senior roles  

## Summary
- Based of the [retirement_titles](Resources/retirement_titles.png)	there is a total of 57,668 of Senior roles about to retire, 
  and based off of the  - [mentorship_eligibilty](Resources/mentorship_eligibilty.png)	full table, a total of 722 Senior roles are elible for mentorship.
- This means that apart from the mentorship program Bobby's manager will have to start a hireing process as this is only just analysising the senior roles,
  there are also a total of 26,465 engineering and staff roles combined with 699 mentorships eligible.
- While there are over 500 mentorship roles available for both senior and entry level jobs, that is still under a 5 percent of the employees retiring.
